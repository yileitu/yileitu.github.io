Welcome to tt's personal website!

I am actively looking for a PhD position in the field of NLP. If you are interested in my profile or have any recommendations for doctoral positions, please feel free to contact me via email.

I am currently a master student in Data Science at [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/) and [Prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/). My research interests lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially Large Language Models (LLMs).

Previously, I obtained my bachelor degree in Statis from [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en), Guangdong, China. I gratefully received advice from [Prof. Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268) with focus on ML/AI+Aviation.
