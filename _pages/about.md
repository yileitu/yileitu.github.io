Welcome to TT's personal website!

**New**: I will pursue my CS PhD degree at [UBC NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) starting 2025 Fall, advised by Profs. [Hila Gonen](https://gonenhila.github.io/), [Jian Zhu](https://lingjzhu.github.io/) and [Isabel Papadimitriou](https://www.isabelpapad.com/).

Previously, I was a Visiting Scholar at [CompLING Lab](https://compling-wat.com/), [UWaterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), advised by [Prof. Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/), focusing on multilingual LLM. Recently, I graduated from [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) with MSc in Data Science. I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Mrinmaya Sachan](https://www.mrinmaya.io/) and [Prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/). My research interests lies in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially the multilingual and/or reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). 

I obtained my bachelor degree in Statistics (Stream: Data Science) from [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). I gratefully received advice from [Prof. Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268) with focus on ML/AI+Aviation.
