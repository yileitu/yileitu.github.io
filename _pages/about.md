<!-- [Looking for a job]

[Deferred due to prolonged Canadian visa check] ~~Starting September 2025, I will be pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the [UBC NLP Group](https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), co-supervised by Profs. [Hila Gonen](https://gonenhila.github.io/)([Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/)) and [Jian Zhu](https://lingjzhu.github.io/)([Department of Linguistics](https://linguistics.ubc.ca/)). I will also closely collaborate with Prof. [Isabel Papadimitriou](https://www.isabelpapad.com/). My research will focus on multilingual language models and speech models.~~ -->

In 2024, I earned my M.Sc. in Data Science from the from [Department of Computer Science](https://inf.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Ryan Cotterell](https://rycolab.io/authors/ryan/) and [Prof. Mrinmaya Sachan](https://lre.inf.ethz.ch/). I also worked closely with [Prof. Peter Egger](https://mtec.ethz.ch/people/person-detail.MTY2NTM0.TGlzdC8xOTE1LC0yMDgyMjgwMDQ4.html) and [Dr. Susie Rao](https://susierao.github.io/about/). My research focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP), with an emphasis of LLM Applications. In the last few months of 2024, I was a Visiting Scholar at the [CompLING Lab](https://compling-wat.com/) at the [University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/), where I worked with [Prof. Freda Shi](https://home.ttic.edu/~freda/), focusing on multilingual LLMs. 

In 2020, I obtained my B.Sc. in Statistics (Stream: Data Science) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en). I gratefully received advice from [Prof. Jianfeng Mao](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en/teacher/268) with focus on AI/ML × Aviation.
