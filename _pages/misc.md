In my spare time, I like to play boardgames and watch movies & TV series. I co-founded [CUHKSZ Board Game Club](https://osa.cuhk.edu.cn/en/student-organizations) and I am a member of [GECo](https://geco.ethz.ch/) at [ETH](https://ethz.ch/en.html)/[UZH](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html). Welcome to scan the QR code to follow the [WeChat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeChat) (Weixin) Offical Account of CUHKSZ Board Game Club (in Chinese). Although I'm no longer actively involved, I still want to promote my club ðŸ¤ª.
